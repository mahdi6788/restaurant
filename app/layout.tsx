/* 
The current setup (server RootLayout + client ClientProviders + nested layouts) strikes the best balance for performance, maintainability, and compatibility.
Alternative approach:
Single Client-Side Layout:
To conditionally exclude the header and footer based on the route, keep everything in a single "use client" RootLayout with usePathname. 
This works but sends more JavaScript to the client and loses server-side rendering benefits. 
Itâ€™s simpler but less optimal for performance.
Verdict: Not best practice unless your app heavily relies on client-side interactivity everywhere.
